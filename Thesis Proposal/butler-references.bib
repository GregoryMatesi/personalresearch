title="Uncertainty quantification of two-phase flow problems via measure theory and the generalized multiscale finite element method",
journal="Computational Geosciences",
year="2017",
volume="21",
number="2",
pages="187--204",
abstract="The problem of multiphase phase flow in heterogeneous subsurface porous media is one involving many uncertainties. In particular, the permeability of the medium is an important aspect of the model that is inherently uncertain. Properly quantifying these uncertainties is essential in order to make reliable probabilistic-based predictions and future decisions. In this work, a measure-theoretic framework is employed to quantify uncertainties in a two-phase subsurface flow model in high-contrast media. Given uncertain saturation data from observation wells, the stochastic inverse problem is solved numerically in order to obtain a probability measure on the space of unknown permeability parameters characterizing the two-phase flow. As solving the stochastic inverse problem requires a number of forward model solves, we also incorporate the use of a conservative version of the generalized multiscale finite element method for added efficiency. The parameter-space probability measure is used in order to make predictions of saturation values where measurements are not available, and to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the context of fine and coarse model solves. A number of numerical examples are offered to illustrate the measure-theoretic methodology for solving the stochastic inverse problem using both fine and coarse solution schemes.",

 abstract = {The normative procedure for the design of an experiment is to select a utility function, assess the probabilities, and to choose that design of maximum expected utility. One difficulty with this view is that a scientist typically does not have, nor can be normally expected to have, a clear idea of the utility of his results. An alternative is to design an experiment to maximize the expected information to be gained from it. In this paper we show that the latter view is a special case of the former with an appropriate choice of the decision space and a reasonable constraint on the utility function. In particular, the Shannon concept of information is seen to play a more important role in experimental design than was hitherto thought possible.},
